        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            if (numbers.get(i).equals(numbers.get(j))) {
                duplicates.add(numbers.get(i));
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return duplicates;
}
```

## Adapting Academic Knowledge to Professional Settings

1. **Focus on Readability and Maintainability**
   - Write self-documenting code
   - Follow established coding standards and best practices

2. **Emphasize Collaboration**
   - Learn to work with version control in a team setting
   - Communicate effectively about technical issues

3. **Understand the Business Context**
   - Learn how your code fits into the larger project or product
   - Consider scalability and long-term maintenance

4. **Embrace Continuous Learning**
   - Stay updated with new Java features and industry trends
   - Be open to learning new tools and frameworks

5. **Develop Problem-Solving Skills**
   - Break down complex problems into manageable parts
   - Research and apply design patterns appropriately

## Conclusion
Preparing for a Java internship involves more than just coding skills. By focusing on these key areas and practicing with real-world scenarios, you'll be well-equipped to make the most of your internship opportunity and transition successfully into a professional development environment.

# Modern Java Features Guide

## Introduction
This guide covers key features introduced in Java 8 and later versions, demonstrating how to use them effectively in modern Java development.

## Java 8 Features

### 1. Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions enable you to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data.

```java
// Before Java 8
Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
};

// With Lambda
Runnable runnable = () -> System.out.println("Hello, World!");
```

### 2. Functional Interfaces
Functional interfaces have a single abstract method and can be used with lambda expressions.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Converter<F, T> {
    T convert(F from);
}

Converter<String, Integer> converter = (from) -> Integer.valueOf(from);
Integer converted = converter.convert("123");
System.out.println(converted);    // 123
```

### 3. Method References
Method references provide easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods that already have a name.

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");

// Using lambda
names.forEach(s -> System.out.println(s));

// Using method reference
names.forEach(System.out::println);
```

### 4. Stream API
The Stream API allows for functional-style operations on streams of elements.

```java
List<String> myList = Arrays.asList("a1", "a2", "b1", "c2", "c1");

myList.stream()
      .filter(s -> s.startsWith("c"))
      .map(String::toUpperCase)
      .sorted()
      .forEach(System.out::println);
```

### 5. Optional
Optional is a container object used to contain not-null objects, helping to avoid NullPointerException.

```java
Optional<String> optional = Optional.of("hello");

optional.ifPresent(s -> System.out.println(s.length()));

String result = optional.orElse("world");
```

## Java 9+ Features

### 1. Module System (Java 9)
The module system allows you to create modular JAR files and define dependencies between modules.

```java
module com.example.mymodule {
    requires java.sql;
    exports com.example.mypackage;
}
```

### 2. var Keyword (Java 10)
The `var` keyword allows local variable type inference.

```java
var list = new ArrayList<String>();  // infers ArrayList<String>
var stream = list.stream();          // infers Stream<String>
```

### 3. Switch Expressions (Java 12, enhanced in Java 14)
Switch expressions provide a more concise way to write switch statements.

```java
String result = switch (day) {
    case MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY -> "Relax";
    case TUESDAY -> "Work";
    case THURSDAY, SATURDAY -> "Party";
    case WEDNESDAY -> "Midweek";
    default -> "Unknown";
};
```

### 4. Text Blocks (Java 15)
Text blocks provide a way to write multiline string literals.

```java
String json = """
              {
                  "name": "John Doe",
                  "age": 30,
                  "city": "New York"
              }
              """;
```

## Best Practices for Incorporating Modern Features

1. **Use Streams for Collection Processing**
   Replace traditional for-loops with stream operations for better readability and potential parallelism.

2. **Leverage Optional for Null Handling**
   Use Optional to explicitly indicate that a value might be absent, improving null safety.

3. **Prefer Method References Over Lambdas When Possible**
   Method references often provide more readable and concise code compared to equivalent lambdas.

4. **Utilize Functional Interfaces**
   Design your interfaces to be functional when appropriate, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.

5. **Embrace Local Variable Type Inference**
   Use `var` to reduce verbosity, but be cautious not to obscure important type information.

6. **Modularize Your Applications**
   Take advantage of the module system to create more maintainable and encapsulated codebases.

## Conclusion
Incorporating these modern Java features can significantly improve code readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Stay updated with the latest Java releases to leverage new features and best practices in your development work.
