Multiple occurrences of the same character will not be stored in the StringBuilder 'b'.
// This program identifies duplicate characters in a given string and isolates the duplicate characters into the StringBuilder 'b'
// The program then checks if the character is already in the StringBuilder 'b' using the (d && indexOf(String.valueOf(c)) == -1) method to determine if the character is already in the StringBuilder 'b' or not.
// If the character is not in the StringBuilder 'b', then we append the character to the StringBuilder 'b' and then append a space " " after it. 
// Finally, we check if the StringBuilder 'b' has a length of 0, and if it does, we output "Say something 1....", and if it doesn't, we output "characters found: " and the characters in the StringBuilder 'b' with a space " " after each character.
