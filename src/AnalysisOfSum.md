* **Outer loop:** `O(n)` - iterates over the length of the string `a`.
* **Inner loop:** `O(i)` - iterates up to the current index `i` of the outer loop.
* **StringBuilder operations (append and indexOf):** `O(1)` - constant time operations.
* **if-else statement:** `O(1)` - constant time operation.
* **println statement:** `O(1)` - constant time operation.

Since the inner loop's complexity is `O(i)`, the overall complexity is determined by the sum of the inner loop's iterations across all outer loop iterations. This can be represented as:

```
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1) 
```

This sum is equivalent to `n(n-1)/2`, which simplifies to `O(n^2)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code is still **O(n^2)**, but the reasoning is slightly different. The nested loops, with the inner loop's complexity being dependent on the outer loop's index, contribute to the quadratic time complexity.
